•Utilized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), pitch, and formant frequencies to extract relevant features from users'voice samples for accurate authentication.
•Applied Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron models for voice authentication, achieving over 97% accuracy in both models,  
demonstrating robust performance.
• Developed a custom object-oriented machine learning model to encapsulate the authentication logic, ensuring modularity and 
Scalability of the system.
